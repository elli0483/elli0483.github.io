    <p>Hello, my name is <abbr title="Rad Observant Baller Young Neat">Robyn</abbr> Elliott and I turned 18 a few weeks ago, my birthday is September 18<sup>th</sup>. I recently graduated from highschool and chose to come to Algonquin with little knowledge of the school. I chose this program because I have a strong interest in videography and hope to do it in the future!
    </p>
    <p>I love camping and going on hikes, I enjoy the outdoors and staying up late to watch the stars. In the winter I go skiing with my friends and in the summer I go tubing on lakes. Taking naps and reading books are some of the things I do for fun.
    </p>
